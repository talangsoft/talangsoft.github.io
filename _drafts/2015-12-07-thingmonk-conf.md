Even before I went to the <a href="https://2016.agilecontentconf.com/" target="_blank">THINGMONK</a> conference, it was special for me for two reasons:

- I was working for 6 months on a project that was about Internet of Things

- I got a free ticket for the conference from <a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/london" target="_blank">Women Who Code London</a> whose mission
is to inspire more women to excel in technology careers.

I really liked the nice foods and drinks, the wide variety of speakers, the topics and the venue as well but the best of
all was the family-like atmosphere during the whole conference.

I also learnt on the conf how much it means to be connected to others, to use every opportunity to network with people
who has similar fields of interest.
