      <description>I have been reading the book ‘Thanks for the Feedback’ by Douglas Stone and Sheila Heen and it got me thinking… How interesting it is that from the moment we are born and starting to understand the world around us, we are getting feedbacks and it seems that even when we are 80, we still cannot receive them well. And it is not only happening with negative feedbacks, we can also feel uneasy when someone is praising us.</description>
